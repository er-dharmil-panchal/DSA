> *“Master the fundamentals, and you’ll conquer any problem.”*

Hey there! I’m **Dharmil**, and this repository documents a structured approach to learning and implementing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**.  
It is designed to serve as a long-term resource — focusing on **core implementations, concept notes, and problem-solving practice**.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation for competitive programming, technical interviews, and efficient problem-solving.

## 🎯 About
>🗓️ **Started On:** *October 27, 2025*

This repository covers the implementation and practice of fundamental **data structures** and **algorithms** in Java.  
Each topic includes:
- **Implementation** → Core data structure or algorithm code  
- **Problems** → Related coding challenges  
- **Notes.md** → Key concepts, complexities, and pitfalls  

> The learning flow is inspired by **Striver’s A2Z DSA roadmap**, restructured for clean Java implementation.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

A structured, repeatable approach to ensure long-term retention and efficient problem-solving:

1. **Understand** → Learn the concept and logic first  
2. **Implement** → Write your own version in Java  
3. **Solve** → Practice related problems from coding platforms  
4. **Document** → Summarize logic, complexity, and pitfalls in `Notes.md`  

> 🔁 Consistency Formula: *Understand → Code → Solve → Note → Revisit* (every 3 days, weekly)
